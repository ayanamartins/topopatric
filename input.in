#Parameter description
T - time in number of generations (1 generation = N reproductive events)

N - number of individuals (constant)

ntrials - number of mate assessed before mating

mu - mutation rate per locus per reproductive event

m - mortality rate. Dead individuals will be replaced by newly born individuals

detalt - time interval to calculate number of species and other metrics

G - relative reproductive threshold

B - number of loci

window - number of generations over each number of species is tested for stability

independent_loci - if .true. each locus is transmitted independently. If .false.
a single crossover occurs in each reproductive events

discretegen - if .true. generations are discretegen

DMI - specifies if genetic incompabilities are intralocus (Hamming distance)
or interlocus (DMI)/ .false. or .true. respectively

IREAD - if = 1, starts simulation from a previous file

INIS - initial spatial distribution (0 = random, 1 = centralized)

INISBIT - initial genotypes (0 = identical and equal to 0 in every loci,
1 = random)

nparameter - number of paramenters sets to used in this run

replica - number of replica for each parameter set
